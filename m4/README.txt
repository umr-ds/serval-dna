The Autoconf macros in this directory were copied from the GNU Autoconf Archive
http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf-archive/, and modified as needed.

The autoreconf(1) command generates an aclocal.m4 file, which includes all the
files in this directory that define macros that are used by configure.in.

See INSTALL.md for more information.
